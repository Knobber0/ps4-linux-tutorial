# Key information
This tutorial will cover how to install Linux on your PS4. It was originally created because the PS4Linux.com's guide was old, hard to understand, incomplete and with tons of ads. The site was updated recently, but the guide section hasn't really changed.

Still, thanks to noob404 for their website, as this is a better-put-together version of their work. This guide wouldn't exist without it.

::: details Is it reversible? Will it delete all my games and saves?
All your data will stay intact. Whether you install it on the internal HDD or an external drive, you will keep your data as you first need to exploit your console at every boot.

The internal drive method actually creates a file as big as you want it to be which is going to be mounted whenever you launch Linux as it's own virtual hard disk, so it won't overwrite any data you have on your console.
For the external drive method your HDD isn't even touched at all.

TLDR: yes it is reversible, and no you won't loose any data.

::: details What consoles are compatible?
All consoles that can run a homebrew enabler (like GoldHEN or ps4hen) are able to run Linux.

At the time of writing, the newest compatible firmware is 12.52.

However, every console has a different southbridge, and Baikal in particular has many issues. You should be able to get a working installation either way.
