# Compiling your own kernel
This page contains content on how to compile your own kernel.

> [!WARNING]
> If you cannot understand any of this get the fuck out.

## Rquirements:

- Semi-Decent Machine. The ps4 itself can be used as well.

- Reading capability.

- Patience.

## Where to start?

- First you should start by choosing the method you will use to compile the kernel with.

## Which methods are available?

- You can manually compile using commands by following the [archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel/Arch_build_system). Or you can do the far more user friendly approach by using [linux-tkg](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg). In this page only linux-tkg will be covered as its far more user friend and just easier to use.


## Step 1 - Setup

- First clone the linux-tkg repo.

  ```
  https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg.git
 
  ```
- Download the modified PKGBUILD file and place it into the directory.

- Download using this link [here](https://github.com/FlyingPhantom/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/PKGBUILD).

- You will also need to install couple packages needed to compile you can copy the provided command:

  ```
  yay -S --needed base-devel git ccache schedtool clang lld llvm \
  bison xmlto docbook-xsl inetutils bc libelf pahole patchutils flex \
  python-sphinx python-sphinx_rtd_theme graphviz imagemagick cpio \
  perl tar xz wget --noconfirm

  ```


## Step 2 - Configuring the linux-tkg project

- Go into $HOME/.config and make a directory called *frogminer*

- After that go back to *linux-tkg* and copy the "customization.cfg" into the *.config/frogminer* directory but rename the file to "linux-tkg.cfg".

- Open the config file and change "_git_mirror=" to "_git_mirror="https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx.git"

> **NOTE: this kernel is only aoelia-belize go to his repo to find kernels for baikal.**

- This will clone the 6.15.4 kernel wen you select it.

- Example with images will be provided here.

> **NOTE: Im using offline mode here so you will not see other kernels besides ones that have been cloned.**

> **NOTE:Fixing the pkgbuild**

>- The linux-tkg project does not allow the option for kernel output to be compiled as bzImage, i made a pr request but it has been rejected so for now you will need to use a modified PKGBUILD file.

>- This is only for arch because its the distro i use i dont know for other distros but you will have to modify ./install.sh script if you dont use arch.

>- You can download the follow modded PKGBUILD file from this link [here](https://github.com/FlyingPhantom/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/PKGBUILD).


## Step 3 - Recommended settings.

- Config for linux-tkg.cfg will be provided [here](https://github.com/FlyingPhantom/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/linux-tkg.cfg). I will call this the recommended config because it has been tuned for the ps4 and minimizing compile time. If you wanna lower the compile times even more check out [modprobed-db](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Modprobed-db) on archwiki.

- The config will be used automatically if you followed up the Step 1 of the guide.

- Cd in the the linux-tkg with this command:

  ```
  cd linux-tkg
  
  ```

- Now run the *makepkg -o* to check if everything is working fine then run *makepkg -s* command to and follow the instructions of the linux-tkg to build the kernel.
