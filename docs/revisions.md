Overview of revisions and southbridges
We need to clear any confusion for people that are new to this stuff. The PS4 is a relatively quirky console and it can get pretty confusing with the myriad of models there are.

## Southbridges
The PS4 family is also divided into 3 major Southbridges:
### Aeolia
The oldest and very supported for Linux, but is known to have some Wi-Fi or Bluetooth chips that may not work with some kernels.

It's only present on early Fat models.

### Belize
The second gen Southbridge, and the one with the most support. Gets kernel updates faster and doesn't have any particular problems.

It can be found on late Fat models, but also on Slims and Pros.

### Baikal
The third and final Southbridge, released very late into the console's lifespan, and the one with the most broken support. It does not have supprot for internal HDD installation, and is known to have issues with wifi and bluetooth especially on PS4 Pros, but you can get a working system now days as most of the drivers for Baikal have been added to the kernel source..
