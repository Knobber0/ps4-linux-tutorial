# Baikal issues

Theres lots of problems to baikal systems while lack of being widespread to the developers is the issue as well its not that entirely. Regardless of that this page will go over the issues present in the baikal system when trying to run linux.

- Older kernel, baikal users are on 5.4 when the rest have moved over to 6.x kernels

- Higher mesa than 25.1 will not work due to upgraded libdrm that needs newer kernel.

- Wayland as default graphics platform won't work, only X11, one can however launch a Wayland session after first executing X11.

- Ethernet (LAN) doesn't work.

- Internal writing speeds are slow due to UFS encryption, one can however install internally.
