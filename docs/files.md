## Kernels
This section covers recommended kernels. There are both vanilla kernels and performance kernels. Ordered by newest to oldest, the top ones are the recommended ones.

[Credits for all of these kernels](ending#credits).

::: details Which one to pick?
Hard to say as there's many of them, but I'd recommend starting from the top (mind the Southbridge) and going down until you can find one that works.

If all you care about is squeezing as much performance as possible out of the PS4, try the performance kernel section first. Those have patches to make the system more responsive.

If you still have issues, write on the forums or join the Discords. Links are at the start of the guide.
:::

::: details Do newer kernels matter?
For Baikal, yes indeed. Modern versions of Mesa require modern versions of LibDRM which needs newer versions of the kernels.

But apart from that, not really. New features are mostly added for newer processors and devices, though there are cool things like better performance on specific scenarios and native drivers for things like PS4's controllers, but as long as you have a 5.x+ kernel your experience should be mostly the same, as those support Vulkan.

### Vanilla kernels
These are normal linux kernels with additional patches to make them work properly on the PS4.

### Performance orianted kernels
These kernels are compiled using additional optimizations. Some of them use LTO, some also add CachyOS's patches, and some others also add ZRAM or additional features.

Don't expect a 3x improvement in performance, they just add features and make the system more responsive and generally perform bettter.

> [!NOTE]
> 120Hz only applies to 1080p resolution as of now.

### Specific kernel problems
Before continuing, I want to mention that there can be many issues with kernel and distro combinations.

If you have issues, remember to check the [Issues page](issues).
### More kernels
If you really want to try other and older kernels, even though it's highly discouraged, you can go to the [Legacy and other Kernels](legacy#kernels) section.

If you want more kernels or help, ask out the [Discord servers](/information#important-places).

## Initramfs
This is the rescue shell that boots your Linux installation and allows you to install linux in the first place if not installed already. I'll be using one only, and it's going to be the one that was originally created for PSXITARCH, a distro based on Arch made by the PS3ITA Forums. [Here it is](https://github.com/FlyingPhantom/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/initramfs.zip). [Source (not really)](https://bitbucket.org/piotrkarbowski/better-initramfs/src/master/).

## Payloads
None of this is possible without neccesery payloads to install linux get your payloads [here](https://github.com/FlyingPhantom/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/ps4-linux-payloads.zip). The reason why we need "*non-official*" payloads is because the normal payloads have been splitting the distro and bzImage,initramfs directory without any proper reason which overcomplicates things when trying to help people find issues.

## Distros
There's many distros, most however, are very outdated, especially the ones on the PS4Linux's website list. These distros are newer, supported by updates and recommended. CachyOS was used for this guide, but you can follow the same method of installation for all the other ones reported here.
