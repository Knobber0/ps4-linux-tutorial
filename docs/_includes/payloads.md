## Launching Linux Rescue Shell
After that, either launch your payload with Payload Guest, or use a payload website to load them.
### Payload website hosts

Change your target firmware (in the picture it's firmware 11.50). If it doesn't have any particularly append, it's for both Aeolia and Belize.

Do NOT use Pro payloads on non-Pro consoles.

- [ps4boot.github.io](https://ps4boot.github.io/) (5.05/6.72/9.60) (Webkit method)
- [ps4boot.free.nf/index.html](http://ps4boot.free.nf/index.html) (5.05-12.02) (GoldHEN method, works only with HTTP not HTTPS)

> [!WARNING]
> Use a 1GB VRAM payload for installation and first boot.
> 
> Afterwards, 2GB is recommended.

> [!TIP]
> I cannot believe I have to say this, but remember that the amount of VRAM you allocate is taken from your system memory!
> 
> For example, for a 2GB of VRAM payload, you'd have 8-2 = 6GB of remaining system RAM!
> You aren't creating memory out of thin air!

### Local payloads
It's also possible to load these payloads locally.

In order to do that, go [download them from the ps4boot repositories](https://github.com/ps4boot/ps4-linux-payloads):
- Install "Payload Loader" on your PS4 to load the payloads locally
- Extract from the ELF folders, and rename the file to have a `.bin` extension instead of `.elf`, because Payload Loader can't load ELFs
	- Enable "see file extensions" on Windows Explorer or what you're using
	- If it doesn't have any particularly append, it's for both Aeolia and Belize
- Remember to check sometimes to see if there's any updates
